|END_OF_DICTIONARY|
Call me Ishmael. |!0u years ago- |0z mind how long precisely- having |0n or no money in my purse, and |0j |08 to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail |0t a |0n and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I |01 of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. |!0r I find myself growing grim |0t the mouth; |0r it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; |0r I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin |0d, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially |0r my hypos get such an upper hand of me, |0m it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me |0k deliberately stepping |02 the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off- then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. |!0w is my substitute for pistol and ball. |!0b a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself |0a his sword; I quietly take to the ship. |!0p is |0j surprising in |0w. If |0y but knew it, almost all men in their degree, |0u time or |04, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean |0b me.
There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs- commerce surrounds it |0b her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the battery, where |0m noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.
Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go |0k Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and |0k thence, by Whitehall, northward. |!06 do you see?- Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands |0a thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. |!0u leaning against the spiles; |0u seated |0a the pier-heads; |0u looking over the bulwarks of ships |0k China; |0u high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster- tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is |0w? Are the green fields gone? |!06 do |0y here?
But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the |0i, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! |!0j will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder |0d will not suffice. No. |!0y must get just as nigh the |0i as |0y possibly can |0q falling And |0p |0y stand- miles of them- leagues. Inlanders all, |0y come |0k lanes and alleys, streets avenues- north, east, south, and west. Yet here |0y all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither?
Once more. Say you are in the country; in |0u high land of lakes. Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you |0p by a pool in the stream. |!0p is magic in it. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries- stand |0m man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to |0i, if |0i |0p be in all |0m region. Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try |0w experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied |0b a |07 professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and |0i are wedded for ever.
But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco. |!06 is the chief element he employs? |!0p stand his trees, each |0b a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and |0p sleep his cattle; and up |0k yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep |02 distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. But |03 the picture lies thus tranced, and |03 |0w pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves |0a |0w |0o head, yet all were vain, unless the |0o eye were fixed |0a the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies- |06 is the one charm wanting?- Water- |0p is not a drop of |0i |0p! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, |0a suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy |0b a robust healthy soul in him, at |0u time or |04 crazy to go to sea? Why |0a your first |0c as a |0h, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told |0m you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all |0w is not |0q meaning. And still deeper the meaning of |0m story of Narcissus, who |0v he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged |02 it and was drowned. But |0m same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and |0w is the key to it all.
Now, when I say |0m I am in the habit of going to sea |0r I begin to grow hazy |0t the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do not mean to |01 it inferred |0m I ever go to sea as a |0h. For to go as a |0h you must needs |01 a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless you |01 |0x in it. Besides, |0e get sea-sick- grow quarrelsome- don't sleep of nights- do not enjoy |0g much, as a general thing;- no, I |0z go as a passenger; nor, |03 I am |0x of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all honorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself, |0q taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and |06 not. And as for going as cook,- |03 I confess |0p is considerable glory in |0m, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board- yet, somehow, I |0z fancied broiling fowls;- |03 once |05, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, |0p is no one who will speak more |09, not to say reverentially, of a |05 fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians |0a |05 ibis and roasted river horse, |0m you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bakehouses the pyramids.
No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple |0f, right before the mast, plumb down |02 the |0A, aloft |0p to the royal mast-head. True, |0y rather order me |0t |0u, and make me jump |0k spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, |0w sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one's sense of honor, particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if just previous to putting your hand |02 the tar-pot, you |01 been lording it as a country |00, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, |0k a |00 to a |0f, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even |0w wears off in time.
What of it, if |0u old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks? |!06 does |0m indignity amount to, weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, |0v I promptly and |09 obey |0m old hunks in |0m |08 instance? Who ain't a slave? Tell me |0m. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may order me about- however |0y may thump and punch me |0t, I |01 the satisfaction of knowing |0m it is all right; |0m everybody else is one way or |04 served in much the same way- either in a physical or |07 point of view, |0m is; and so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each other's shoulder-blades, and be content.
Again, I always go to sea as a |0f, |0v |0y make a point of paying me for my trouble, whereas |0y |0z pay |0e a single penny |0m I ever heard of. On the contrary, |0e |0g must pay. And |0p is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction |0m the two orchard thieves entailed |0a us. But being paid,- |06 will compare |0b it? The urbane activity |0b which a man receives money is really marvellous, considering |0m we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and |0m on no account can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!
Finally, I always go to sea as a |0f, |0v of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the |0A deck. For as in |0w world, head winds are far more prevalent than winds |0k astern (|0m is, if you |0z violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand |0k the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many |04 |0l, at the same time |0m the leaders |0n suspect it. But wherefore it was |0m after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant |0f, I should now take it |02 my head to go on a |0s voyage; |0w the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in |0u unaccountable way- he can better answer than any one else. And, doubtless, my going on |0w |0s |0c, formed part of the grand programme of Providence |0m was drawn up a long time ago. It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances. I take it |0m |0w part of the bill must |01 run |0x like this:
"Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States. "WHALING |!0c BY ONE ISHMAEL." "BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN."
Though I cannot tell why it was exactly |0m those stage managers, the Fates, put me down for |0w shabby part of a |0s |0c, when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces- |03 I cannot tell why |0w was exactly; yet, now |0m I recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a |0n |02 the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced me to set |0t performing the part I did, besides cajoling me |02 the delusion |0m it was a choice resulting |0k my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment.
Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, |0b all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds, helped to sway me to my wish. |!0b |04 men, perhaps, such |0l would not |01 been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented |0b an everlasting itch for |0l remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring |06 is good, I am quick to perceive a horror, and could still be social |0b it- would |0y let me- since it is but well to be on friendly terms |0b all the inmates of the place one lodges in.
By reason of these |0l, then, the |0s |0c was welcome; the great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild conceits |0m swayed me to my purpose, two and two |0p floated |02 my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.
